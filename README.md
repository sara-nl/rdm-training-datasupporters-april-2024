Date: Thursday April 11, 2024, 10:00 - 16:30 (Walk in starts at 09:30)

Location: SURF Amsterdam, Science Park 140, 1098 XG Amsterdam

For whom: Data supporters with non-technical and/or technical interests

Calling all data supporters!

Do you want to know more about the tools and facilities for compute and data to better support researchers in Research Data Management (RDM)? Then please join us for this in-person training! We will be covering the whole research data lifecycle with discussions and demos of available tools - think of RDM platforms, compute and data infrastructure facilities, publication workflows, etc. Note that the focus is not on the technical details of the tools/facilities but on what these can do for your RDM needs! However, for those participants who do want to follow-along the practical steps in these demos, we are happy to facilitate this. 

We are particularly interested in tackling some of the big challenges data stewards and other data professionals are facing in the realm of RDM. Expect lively discussion, opportunities to consider your own use cases, and a good lunch!
