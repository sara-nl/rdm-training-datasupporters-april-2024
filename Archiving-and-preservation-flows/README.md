## Premise
We are at the last step of your research data lifecycle: the analysis is done, the results have been published, now you want to preserve your data. Of course, always keeping in mind our FAIR desires. 

In this module, we will cover:

1. The significance of preservation in the context of FAIR and Open Science policies
2. Long-term storage of data
3. Persistent Identifiers and Data Repositories

## Prerequisites

- A dataset that you need to preserve and that you want to make findable.

## 1. Long term preservation

There are many reasons to preserve data, on top of requirements from funding agencies, University/Institute policies, more importantly, we should preserve Data to make our research more Open and repeatable. 
This is especially crucial when talking about non-repeatable observations. Think Astronomy, Climate science, things that cannot be reproduced in a lab.
Moreover, Archiving datasets is also bound to make research cheaper, repeating observations and/or experiments is a waste of resources.

**How to choose storage?**
> * length of storage
> * Volume of data
> * Need of access

Just archiving or publishing? depends on uniqueness, cost involved in reproducing, and rules you have to abide by 
```
Archiving? surf data archive, other resources
In-house solutions, many Universities have storage solutions.
