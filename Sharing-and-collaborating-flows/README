## Let's recap
Following from this morning's activities, we have our raw data saved in Research Drive and some analysis has taken place via Snellius. Whatever our initial plans as researchers, the results tend to throw us in a different direction, and indeed in this case the output suggests that a few more pairs of eyes are needed. It's time to pull in some collaborators, but using what means?  

In this module, we will address some of the common technical issues, review some popular collaboration platforms in NL (with a focus on the differences between SURF services) and discuss best practices. This should help you as a data professional when it comes to advising researchers on how to tackle the sharing of data and collaborating. 

## 1. Prerequisites

- SURF Research Drive account username/password (from previous module)
- SURF Yoda account username/password

## 2. Challenges and platforms 

We need to: 
- Share data securely and with appropriate access controls
- Prevent any loss of data through mishap
- Ensure that all collaborators are looking at the same version 
- Work interoperably for all parties

What are researchers using? 
- Storage platforms (e.g., SURF Research Drive)
- Analysis platforms (e.g., SURF Research Cloud)
- RDM platforms (e.g., SURF Yoda)
- Code-specific platforms (e.g., Github, Gitlab)
- Locally developed options

> **_Food for thought:_**
> * What are our real-life experiences of this stage? 
> * In an ideal working environment, collaboration goes hand in hand with replication. (Does everyone get the same results with the same dataset and analysis approach?) How can this be supported by technical infrastructure? 

## 3. Start using Yoda

//The portal can be found [here](https://scuba-yoda.irods.surfsara.nl). Login with your credentials...
//Upload dataset to Yoda, note the metadata schema
//Have a data manager review the dataset and accept/reject 

## 4. Best practices
We've been considering a scenario in which a DMP was either foregone or lacking in a plan to address the specific need of collaborating on the active data set. Hopefully this illustrates the importance of creating DMPs that outline data sharing and collaboration strategies from the outset of research projects. 

What are the key elements? 
- Plan of action that includes tools/platforms that you can assess for:
  - Standardised metadata (facilitate data discovery and interoperability)
  - Security and compliance (encryption, access control, data regulations) 
  - ...

> **_Food for thought:_** 
> * Berend Mons recently used the FAIR acronym to talk about being Fully AI Ready. What does this mean in terms of sharing and collaboration? Think of machine readability and standardised language. 
> * Is an RDM layer really necessary for collaboration? It can be a large overhead, and possibly not achievable with certain project restrictions. What then? 

5. What next?
