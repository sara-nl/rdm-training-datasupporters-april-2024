Begin the adventure of a researcher who is going to conduct a project where they will re-use data.
First we describe an imaginary researcher who is looking for a dataset to work with. 
They go to their datasteward decribing their project and asking how they can find data.
Together they establish where the users could look.
-SURFSharekit
-DataVerse
-SURF Data Repository 
-Any public repository available

How to search these databases? 
Live example
Think about what the project is about what are the keywords
-Too broad and its like finding a needle in a haystack
-Too specific and you find nothing at all
By seeing the limitations in searching you can learn the importance of Findability

Start by looking in SURFSharekit
Next SURF Data repository(not great for this)
Finally dataverse.nl 
We find this dataset
https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/RANITN
Perfect for the researchers project on political scandals. 
The researcher downloads the data and saves it onto their Research Drive
